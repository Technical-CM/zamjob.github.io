        <h2>ARREARS TO BE CLEARED</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-text"> <b><i>...LOCAL GOVERNMENT PS ASSURES COUNCIL WORKERS</i></b></h4>


        <div class="headline"></div>
		  
        <p><small>Maambo Haamaundu</small><br>By John Nyambe </p>
        <br>
		  
        <p class="intro-text">The Government has announced 
          that it has scaled up measures to 
          ensure that salary arrears for 
          Council workers are cleared by 
          November 2023
<p>
  Speaking in Lusaka, Permanent 
  Secretary for Administration in the 
  Ministry of Local Government and 
  Rural Development Maambo 
  Haamaundu explained that when 
  the New Dawn government took 
  office in August 2021, some 
  council workers had not received 
  salaries for up to seven months 
  saying it was encouraging that the 
  government has managed to pay 
  some council workers their 
  arrears.
<br>
<br>
Mr. Haamaundu stressed that 
as at of October 2023, Lusaka City 
Council workers in particular had 
their July arrears cleared.
“The story of salaries is almost 
coming to an end; we probably 
need to enhance engagement with 
the public. When the UPND took 
over government, the arrears were 
around five, six to seven months 
but as we speak now, Lusaka City 
Council in particular has paid all 
its workers up to July and I am 
aware that they have paid their 
division four for August,”
“By the time we get to the end of 
this month (October) we should be 
done with August. The plan is that 
by the time we are getting into 
November, they should be up to 
date in terms of salary arrears,” said 
Mr Haamaundu.
And Mr. Haamaundu added that 
L u s a k a C i t y C o u n c i l w a s 
coordinating well with the Unions 
and other stakeholders in ensuring 
that revenue collection was 
maximized.
“There is a team at Lusaka City 
Council working very well, they are 
coordinating, the unions are 
working together with management 
to ensure that they maximize on 
revenue collection and they have 
been going around places in Lusaka 
collecting these revenues,” he 
added.

<h2>NO SELECTIVITY TO EMPOWERMENT OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
<h4 class="sub-text"> <b><i>...Government has clarified that it will not be selective</i></b></h4>

        <p><small>Cornelius Mweetwa</small><br>By John Nyambe </p>

        <p class="intro-text">Government has clarified that it 
          will not be selective in the issuing 
          of empowerment funds to 
          beneficiaries, chief government 
          spokesperson has said.
           Information and Media minister 
          Cornelius Mweetwa said at a 
          media briefing that the government 
          would accord equal opportunity to 
          every deserving individual 
          regardless of their political 
          affiliation.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mweetwa explained that he 
          has received reports of some 
          youths belonging to the ruling 
          complaining that they were 
          marginalized in accessing 
          empowerment funds.</p>

        <p>He explained that the 
          government would not 
          discriminate citizens during the 
          disbursement of the Constituency 
          Development Fund (CDF) adding 
          that all were welcome to access 
          the funds.
           “It is true that a number of our 
          supporters may not have accessed 
          the opportunities that the New 
          Dawn administration has put in 
          place for them to benefit from 
          change of government and I want 
          to put it very clear and categorical 
          that the New Dawn administration 
          has no special package for its 
          supporters,”
           “The government when it was 
          elected has the mandate to provide 
          opportunities for all its citizens and 
          we are telling our citizens that it is 
          abnormal for our supporters to 
          think that they should be given 
          special treatment in accessing 
          opportunities that the government 
          creates for its citizens,” said Mr. 
          Mweetwa
           And Mr. Mweetwa who is also 
          Chief Governments spokesperson 
          reiterated that government will not 
          entertain any acts of cadrerism in 
          the markets, bus stations or any 
          public place from anybody adding 
          that government will create an 
          enabling environment for all to 
          operate freely.
           He further added that those 
          that feel that they have been left 
          out in opportunities that 
          government has created should 
          seek guidance from his office.
           “Radicalization of taking over 
          markets, beating people, violating 
          the law with impunity will not be 
          entertained but my message to all 
          is that you are not on your own, 
          we shall create opportunities that 
          you must access and you must not 
          be discriminated on the basis that 
          you belong to this or that political 
          party as you access these 
          empowerment funds through CDF,” 
          added Mweetwa.</p>

        <p class="intro-text">Minister of Youth, Sport and 
          Arts Elvis Nkandu says government 
          is aware of the challenges that 
          athletes across the country face.
          </p>

        <p>This is due to limited 
         investment in sports preparation 
         and development in the country.
         In a speech read for him by 
         Permanent Secretary in the 
         Ministry, Chileshe Kangwa in 
         Lusaka during the presentation of 
         medals by the world fitness 
         federation of Zambia and trophies 
         by the Zambia ladies Golf Union, 
         Mr. Nkandu noted that the many 
         challenges that athletes face have 
         been a hindrance in their career.
         He stressed that despite the 
         challenges, athletes have continued 
         to perform well both at local and 
         international levels. He said the 
         government was proud of them and 
         would ensure it provides matching 
         infrastructure and support in order 
         to develop sport in the country.
         </p>

        <p>“As Minister for sports and a 
          representative of the Zambian 
          Government, I fully acknowledge 
          the challenges our athletes face 
          while competing at various 
          tournaments and competitions. It is 
          clear that the limited investment in 
          the sports preparation and 
          development in our country has 
          been a hindrance to our athletes. 
          Their success in international 
          tournaments reminds us of the 
          importance of continuously 
          ensuring that that Government 
          provides matching infrastructure 
          and support in order to develop 
          sport in the country,” Nkandu said. 
          Meanwhile, Zambia Ladies Golf 
          Union president Carol Joynt and 
          World Fitness Federation president 
          Peter Chanda thanked government 
          for support it has continued to 
          render to sports.
          Zambia participated at the just 
          ended World Fitness Federation in 
          South Africa held on 30th 
          September, 2023 and walked away 
          with nine medals while the Zambia 
          Ladies Golf Union participated in 
          the A and B Triangular 
          Championship held in Botswana 
          from 29th August 2023 to 3rd 
          September 2023 and grabbed two 
          trophies.</p>
